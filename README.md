# Heatwave-and-sentiment-study
The goal is to build a delay model and explore the changing relationship between heatwave and emotions in various states across the United States. We believe that human emotions have a delay in response to heat.

The heat here is 0 and 1, and the mood changes are not binary values. At the same time, the data set contains various other variables.

We wanted to use the Bayesian model in R, but we used python notebook in colab to complete this operation.
